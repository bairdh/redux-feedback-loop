While taking the survey you must answer the question displayed before moving on the next. At any point until the the results page you may go back the to previous page and re-answer the question. When you get to the results page you can still change your answer by clicking on the result you would like to change and ending to changed into the alert that pops up. After the feedback is submitted you will get an alert informing you if the submission success and be redirected back to the beginning of the survey so you complete another one.
